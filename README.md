Project Description

Within this repository lies the blueprint for a digital marketing campaign tailored to a prominent online furniture retailer's sofas section. Tasked with showcasing our expertise, we've meticulously crafted a prototype set of keywords designed to resonate with price-sensitive consumers while adhering to the client's branding and promotional objectives.

Objective:
Our primary aim is to develop a targeted keyword strategy that maximizes return on investment within the client's budget constraints. We prioritize affordability and value, steering clear of luxury-centric messaging to effectively engage our target audience.

Approach:
Employing a blend of exact and phrase match parameters, our strategy focuses on capturing user intent across various product categories, including sofas, convertible sofas, love seats, recliners, and sofa beds. By incorporating modifiers such as 'buy' and 'prices,' we address consumer needs and drive qualified traffic to the client's website.

Key Features:

Strategic keyword selection aligned with the client's branding and promotional goals.
Emphasis on affordability and value to resonate with price-sensitive consumers.
Comprehensive coverage of relevant search queries through diverse keyword combinations.
